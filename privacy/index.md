If you accept analytics, Google Analytics will start and collect **anonymized usage data**.

We do **not** send any personally identifiable information (PII) to Google.  
Please avoid including personal data in URLs or form submissions.

### Data Retention and Purpose
We retain analytics data for up to 14 months to analyze annual trends in website traffic, particularly to understand when students show the most interest in study abroad topics.
This helps us improve the timing and relevance of our content, for example during the spring application period.
All data used for this purpose is anonymized and cannot identify individual users.
