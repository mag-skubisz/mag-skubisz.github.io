If you’re an international student studying in France or planning to move here for your studies - it’s good to know your work options. Especially if you’ll need to support yourself fully or partially while studying. Here’s a guide to legal rules and different job opportunities for students in France.

# Legal Rules

## Working Hours

Both French and international students can work **up to 964 hours per year**. That’s roughly **20 hours per week**, which is about 60% of a full-time job.

* **EU/EEA students:** If you’re from France or another EU country and registered at a French university, you **don’t need a work permit**.
* **Non-EU students:** You need a **long-stay student visa (VLS-TS étudiant)** or a **student residence permit (carte de séjour étudiant)**. Only then can you legally work up to 964 hours per year. Without this, working is illegal.

Exceeding the 964-hour limit may require a **change of status** from student (étudiant) to employee (salarié), so be sure to keep track of your working hours.

## Minimum Wage

France has a legal minimum wage known as the **SMIC (Salaire Minimum Interprofessionnel de Croissance)**, which applies to all workers, including students. In 2025, the SMIC is set at **€11.88** gross per hour, which corresponds to approximately **€9** net per hour after social contributions. This amount represents the legal minimum, meaning that some jobs may offer higher hourly wages depending on the sector and the employer.

## Employment Contracts

Student jobs in France must be covered by a work contract. The most common types include **CDD** (fixed-term contract), **CDI** (permanent contract), and **contrat étudiant**, which is specifically designed for students and usually offers flexible working hours. In some cases, students may also work under temporary agency contracts (intérim) or apprenticeship-style agreements, depending on their status and field of study.

Working without a formal employment contract is illegal in France. This applies to regular jobs (not freelance work) and means you are not protected by labor laws, do not have social security coverage, and are not insured in case of workplace accidents.

# Job Options for Students

## Casual Jobs in France

Some of the most common student jobs include:

* **Hospitality:** waiter, bartender, kitchen assistant
* **Retail:** cashier, stocking shelves
* **Hotels:** reception, cleaning
* **Logistics:** warehouses, delivery companies
* **Events:** security, audience support
* **Babysitting**

## On-Campus Jobs

If you prefer staying on campus, you can work in:

* **University libraries**
* **Administrative assistance**
* **Helping first-year students**
* **Lab assistant** (science students)
* **International events support**
* **Tutoring** (specific for your degree)

Jobs in this category usually offer a flexible or low-intensity schedule, for example around 4 hours per week. You can often find information about these job opportunities on your university’s website or through emails sent to your student email address.

## Seasonal Jobs

These jobs are especially popular among students looking to earn extra income during university breaks:

- In winter, opportunities are often found in the Alps, including hotels, restaurants, and ski rental shops.
- In summer, students can work in tourism, campsites, amusement parks, or even grape harvesting.

Pay varies depending on the type of job, and many positions also provide accommodation and meals.

## Online & Freelance Work

For more flexibility, students can explore **freelancing opportunities** in areas such as:

* **Graphic design, IT, or social media management**
* **Writing and translation**
* **Online customer support**
* **Online tutoring**

* [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/)
* [Freelancer.com](https://www.freelancer.com/)

> Keep in mind that while freelance work does not always require a formal contract, once your earnings exceed a certain threshold, you must **register as an auto-entrepreneur** in France. Alternatively, if you’re working across countries, make sure to **check the tax regulations between France and your home country** to determine where you should pay taxes and register legally if needed.

## Internships & Alternance

**Stage (Internship):**

In France, internships are usually paid. The minimum internship stipend is around **€600 per month** (as of 2025), although some companies offer higher pay depending on the sector and location. Internships are an excellent way to **gain practical experience**, build a professional network, and improve your chances of finding full-time employment after graduation. In some cases, an internship can lead directly to a **job offer**, especially in competitive fields such as finance, marketing, or IT.

**Alternance (Work-Study Programs):**

Alternance combines studying and working, allowing students to split their time between school and a company. The pay ranges **from 43% to 100% of the SMIC**, depending on the student’s level of study, age, and the employer. Alternance is highly valued by employers, as it demonstrates **practical skills, work discipline, and real industry experience**. Additionally, it is an excellent way to **finance your studies** while gaining relevant professional experience.

Both internships and alternance are considered serious career-building opportunities in France, often carrying **more weight on a CV than purely part-time jobs**, and they can significantly improve your employability after graduation.

# Summary

Studying in France offers **many legal ways to earn money**, even if your French isn’t perfect—although knowing the language definitely helps. To find a job that suits you, it’s important to **balance your work with your studies** so that earning money doesn’t interfere with your academic progress.

Take a look at your **skills and interests**. For example, you might be able to **teach your native language** if you learn some grammar teaching techniques and understand how to explain differences between your language and that of your students. Alternatively, you could **develop additional skills** to increase your competence and earn more while working the same number of hours.

With the right approach, you can **study and work without stress**, while fully enjoying your time in France!
