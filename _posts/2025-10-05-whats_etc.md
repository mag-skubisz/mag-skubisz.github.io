## What is ETC and why do I think it’s one of the most interesting things my university offers?

One of the things that truly sets Université Grenoble Alpes apart is the **ETC – Enseignement Transversal au Choix**, or Transversal Teaching Units of Your Choice. It sounds serious, but in practice it’s a set of additional modules you can take during the academic year – and they can genuinely enrich your student life.

## ETC: a compulsory course or “a course for fun”

ETC modules can be **compulsory (noté)** – meaning they appear in your regular timetable and are graded, giving you ECTS credits. In my department (DLST –  Département de Sciences et Technologies), some programmes include ETC in the first semester, others in the second.

There are also ETC **non noté – non-compulsory**, ungraded and often paid. But don’t worry, the prices are very reasonable. For example, a semester of Chinese classes (2 hours per week) costs only 60 euros.

Importantly: if you take the same course as an ETC noté, it’s completely free.

Three categories of ETC: languages, sports and interdisciplinary courses.

UGA offers a huge range of modules across three areas:

## 1. Foreign languages – from English to… Catalan and Turkish

The language category includes absolutely everything: from the most popular languages (English, Spanish, Italian) to less common ones, such as Polish, Catalan, Turkish, Arabic or Chinese.

If you want to enrol at a level higher than beginner, you need to take a short placement test or complete the lower levels at UGA first. So if you want to sign up for Arabic B1, you either take the test or complete A1 and A2 at the university.

Classes are usually taught by native speakers and – something worth noting – they are taught in French. ;) It’s not only a great way to learn a language, but also a strong point on your CV, especially if you’re planning an international exchange.

## 2. Interdisciplinary courses – a world of topics you’d never expect

This is where the real variety begins. The list of courses is so wide that it’s hard to sum it up in one breath. Some examples include:

- Prehistoric Man (Homme préhistorique)
- Associative and Union Engagement (Engagement associatif et syndical)
- Women in Ancient Literature (Femmes dans la littérature de l’Antiquité)
- Football and Society: Sociological and Historical Perspectives (Football et sociétés: regard sociologique et historique)
- Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (Initiation à l’intelligence artificielle)
- Introduction to Pharmacology (Connaissance du médicament)
- Entrepreneurial Challenge (Challenge entrepreneurial)
- Gender Equality (Égalités femmes-hommes)
- Environment and Health (Environnement et santé)
- Natural Hazards in Mountain Areas (Les risques naturels en montagne)

And many, many more. The best part is that there are no prerequisites. You can study physics and still enrol in a course on ancient literature or pharmacology. These courses are perfect if you’re curious about something beyond your field and want to broaden your horizons.

## 3. Sports – the biggest selection and the most excitement

This is my favourite category, because for the second year in a row I’ve been choosing sports ETC. I have the impression that this is where the offer is richest.

You can choose familiar sports like volleyball, football or swimming, or try something completely new – from archery, diving (plongée), windsurfing, water polo, mountain biking (VTT), all the way to… grand trampoline (yes, it really exists!).

There are individual and team sports, at different levels, sometimes with separate men’s and women’s groups. UGA also offers special modules for students en situation de handicap, which I think is fantastic.

The most unique category, in my opinion, is sporty de pleine nature – mountain and outdoor sports. There’s a wide selection, especially since UGA is surrounded by mountains and several ski resorts are nearby. You can choose activities such as:

* Mountain Skiing (*ski de montagne*)
* Nordic Skiing (*ski nordique*)
* Via Ferrata (*via ferrata*)
* Climbing (*escalade*)
* Orienteering (*course d’orientation*)
* Mountain – Multi-Activities (*montagne – multi activités*)

## My experiences

In my first year, I chose handball féminin – niveau expert, because I had trained handball for years. We even played matches as part of the module expert avec compétition group and I had a great time. 

This year I decided to try something new and chose grandes voies – niveau expérience (there was no beginner level, so… I just went for it). As part of the module, we went on a three-day trip to Orpierre, not far from Grenoble. We spent the days climbing and the evenings camping. It was one of the most beautiful experiences I’ve had at UGA – I absolutely loved it. I learned how to use the equipment, belay properly and tie the rope – everything a climber needs.

I wholeheartedly recommend this module!

## Why is ETC so special?

I think it’s amazing that the university offers such modules, because they allow you to develop your hobbies outside your main studies, learn something new, and sometimes try things you would never dare to do otherwise. I have a friend who came to UGA on exchange and signed up for windsurfing “just to see what it’s like” — and it completely captivated him! That’s why I really recommend taking the opportunity and choosing something that interests you. And if you have several passions, you can even sign up for multiple modules — as long as they don’t clash with your schedule, there’s no problem. Luckily, most ETC classes take place in the evenings, so they’re easy to fit into your timetable. :)

To sum up: if you study at UGA, definitely give ETC a chance. You might end up with a course that changes your perspective, helps you discover a new hobby, or simply makes your semester more interesting and fulfilling. It’s worth it!
