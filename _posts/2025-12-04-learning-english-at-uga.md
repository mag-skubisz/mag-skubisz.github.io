## What English classes really look like at Université Grenoble Alpes

If you're reading this, you probably already have a good level of English — but you might still be curious about how English learning works at UGA in Grenoble because no matter what your level is, **English is compulsory** for all science students.

## English Is Mandatory from L1 to M2 — No Matter Your Level

In scientific programmes, English is required every year from **L1 to M2**, regardless of whether you're a beginner or you already passed something like **IELTS C2**.
The *only* exception is if you follow a **fully English-taught programme** *and* hold an official English certificate. In that case, you may replace English with another foreign language — but you still can't “skip” languages altogether.

At first this may seem strict or even pointless — why should someone with a C2 level still take English classes?
But at UGA, English for science students isn’t regular English. It’s **Anglais scientifique**: specialised vocabulary, grammar, and communication skills used in scientific research. Since UGA’s science programmes are very **research-oriented**, the goal is to prepare students to work academically in English.

# English in L1

In DLST (the department responsible for scientific bachelor students), English starts in the **second semester of the first year**.
Students pass a level test (SELF) in September, and based on the results, they are placed into groups for semester 2.

Students below **B1/B2** may attend extra classes in semester 1 to strengthen their English before the main course begins. Attending these classes also gives additional points that contribute to the final grade.

## Class Format in L1

One session every two weeks (1.5 hours), plus work on one of three online platforms depending on level:

### **1. Lift Off (A2 target level)**

A self-study remediation programme designed to reinforce basic vocabulary and grammar for students who need foundational support.

### **2. Breakthrough (B1 target level)**

Another remediation track focusing on communication in **science, technology, and health**. It includes 11 guided oral-expression workshops.

### **3. Momentum (B2/C1 target level)**

A hybrid programme with six in-person sessions. Students work with authentic scientific texts and audio materials to prepare for advanced English courses in L2.

### And What About C2 Students? “Onwards” Path

For C2-level students, there is a separate path called **Onwards**. There are **no classes at all** during the semester. Instead, students complete a **guided research project** with an English professor.

I followed this path myself in L1. It involved choosing a research topic, reading scientific papers, and writing an exam-style scientific article based on those sources. The exact format can change each year.

### How You Are Graded in L1

To pass, you must score **at least 10/20**.

* **Below C2:** continuous assessment (platform work + quizzes) + final exam
* **C2:** research project grade + final exam


# English in L2: The Level Goes Up

Group placement in L2 is based on your L1 exam results.
In L2, there is no strict platform-based programme anymore. Teachers adapt to the level of each group, but all groups follow similar content that resembles preparation for **IELTS Academic**:

* listening tasks using scientific podcasts
* scientific vocabulary tests
* reading and analysis of academic texts
* scientific written and oral communication

### L2 Research Project

A compulsory research project is added:

* **Choose a topic**
* **Read at least 7 scientific papers**
* **Prepare an oral presentation**

In semester 1, the presentation is followed by a short Q&A.
In semester 2, the format shifts to an **interview-style defence** of your project.

### How You Are Graded in L2

* final exam
* continuous assessment
* research project

Students in the **C2 group** also complete a research project:

* semester 1: record a podcast about their project
* semester 2: present it orally as part of the final evaluation

# English in L3, Masters, and Beyond

From L3 onward, science students follow English courses run by their **specific scientific departments**. The organisation varies, but the approach stays the same: **the higher the scientific level, the more specialised the English.**
In L3, vocabulary becomes domain-specific (e.g., scientific English in biology rather than general scientific English)
In Master’s programmes, research projects are very advanced and are evaluated by both an English teacher *and a specialist in the field.* 
Additional skills appear: rhetoric, oral defence strategies, scientific argumentation, and communication adapted to different audiences (there’s a huge difference between explaining quantum mechanics to a professor in the field, an adult outsider, or a five-year-old — and UGA wants students to be able to do all three).

# Why This System Works

One of the ideas a UGA English professor shared with me during a short interview I did to prepare content for this article was this:

> Because English is the global language of science, not having the right level eventually becomes a **professional barrier**.

It can prevent students from getting:

* internships
* scholarships or exchange programmes
* research opportunities
* jobs in academia or industry

So while the first two years may be tough for students with lower English proficiency, the long-term benefits are significant.

Even if you already have strong general English skills, **scientific English is an entirely different skillset**.
It requires:

* domain-specific vocabulary
* critical reading
* analysis of graphs and scientific articles
* argumentation
* research communication strategies

These are useful not only for a future PhD, but in countless real-life situations.
I hope this has convinced you that it might be worth investing time in this course. ;)

This is the main English programme for science students at DLST, integrated into the curriculum from L1 to L2.

These are additional English courses that students can sign up for outside of their regular study programme to further improve their language skills.
