Since the deadline for submitting your **vœux on Parcoursup** is fast approaching, I thought it would be a good idea to create this guide on how to make the best choice when selecting a city and university for your studies next academic year. I assume you already have a rough idea of what you want to study or in which field, so here we’ll dive into how to pick the perfect location for you.

# Choosing the Right City in France

When choosing a city for your studies, there are several important factors you should carefully consider:

## Cost of Living – Can You Actually Afford This City?

One of the most important things to consider is whether you can realistically afford living in the city you want to move to. There can be a huge difference in costs between cities in France, so it’s worth checking:

* Average prices of groceries and daily essentials
* Rent prices and standards of apartments or dorms
* Transport costs
* Student discounts available in that city
* Hidden costs you might not think about, like a deposit for your apartment or buying home essentials (plates, kitchenware, etc.)
* Additional necessities, like laundry if your apartment doesn’t have a washing machine – check nearby laundromats and their prices

It’s best to make an average monthly budget and compare which cities are realistically affordable for you, based on your income and/or support from family. If you’re interested in finding a part-time job, check my post: [Working as an International Student in France](https://mag-skubisz.github.io/posts/working-as-an-international-student-in-france/) Just make sure to maintain a balance between work and study. Sometimes it might even be better to choose a smaller city so you have more time for studying and a little less work.

## City Size & Atmosphere – Big City or Small Town?

Let’s say cost isn’t a major concern for you – does that automatically mean you should pick a big city? Not necessarily. Moving out is an amazing opportunity to choose a city that really fits your lifestyle, plans, and interests.

* **Big cities** like Paris, Marseille, or Lyon come with a fast-paced lifestyle, many opportunities, numerous cafés, shops, libraries, and a well-developed public transport system. However, they also have high rent, noise, crowds, parking difficulties, and a higher overall cost of living.

* **Medium-sized cities** like Montpellier, Nantes, or Bordeaux offer slightly lower living costs, less congestion, good infrastructure, and a closer connection to nature. They may have fewer job opportunities, cultural events, and international communities compared to big cities.

* **Small towns** like Annecy, Dijon, or Avignon have much lower living costs, stronger local connections, high safety, and a close connection to nature. On the downside, they often have fewer universities, job opportunities, cultural events, and less public transport.

## Lifestyle – Sea, Mountains, or Countryside?

Beyond city size, location also matters. France is geographically diverse, so consider whether you want to live by the sea, at the foot of the mountains, or in a quiet countryside town. This may not be the most important factor, but it **affects climate, outdoor activities, and your daily lifestyle**.

* **By the sea**: milder climate, water sports, beautiful beaches, but seasonal tourist crowds and higher rent.

* **Mountains**: skiing, hiking, breathtaking views, but harsh winters and sometimes limited transport.

* **Countryside/small towns**: peaceful, cheaper, close to nature, but fewer job opportunities and less infrastructure.

* **Big cities**: more nightlife, cultural events, student organizations, and language exchange opportunities but also higher living costs, more noise, heavier traffic, crowded public transport, and sometimes less green space.

Choosing a location affects not only your view from the window but also **your daily comfort, hobbies, and lifestyle**.

## Transport & Accessibility

Think carefully about **transport**, both inside the city and beyond.

In **big cities**, finding an apartment in the center can be difficult and expensive, so you may have to commute from the outskirts. In **small towns**, you might live very close to campus – I personally have **a 5-minute walk!** – or at the edge of town, which can make transport trickier.

Most importantly, consider transport **outside the city**. If your city doesn’t have good connections by train, bus, or plane, check the nearest stations or airports. For example, if you’re from Germany and want to visit family occasionally, the difference between Strasbourg and Toulouse in terms of travel time and costs is significant.

If you love traveling and exploring nearby areas, it’s worth considering a city’s location in relation to the places you want to visit. For instance, Grenoble is, in my opinion, perfectly situated: it’s close to Annecy, Geneva in Switzerland, Turin in Italy, Montpellier, Avignon, Lyon, and Marseille – and most importantly… the Alps are right at your doorstep!

Of course, things aren’t always black and white – some small towns have excellent transport, and not all big cities are noisy or crowded. These are just general expectations, but it’s important to do your research and learn as much as you can about the city you plan to study in, so there are no unexpected surprises.

# Choosing the Right University

## Quality of the Program (Not Just the University Name)

You might think that a big, well-known university automatically offers the best program in your field. That’s not always the case. From my own experience, the program name doesn’t tell you much about what you will actually study. For example, many universities offer degrees in Computer Science, Physics, or Biology, but each program focuses on different aspects of the field.

Check the curriculum carefully:

* How broad or specialized is it?
* What’s the balance between theory and practice? Which matters more to you?
* Are there labs, lectures, projects, or mandatory internships?
* Are optional modules and flexibility offered?

Often, if you’re just starting your studies, you may not know exactly which part of your field interests you most. Make sure your program allows you to explore different options year by year. For example, my bachelor’s program is very broad: in the first year, all students follow similar courses in *Informatique et Mathématiques Appliquées*, and later we can choose a more math-focused or CS-focused track.

## Internships & Practical Experience

If you are studying a field where hands-on experience is highly valued for finding a job, or if gaining practical skills is important to you, pay attention to whether your program includes mandatory or optional internships. Of course, you can do an internship even if it’s not part of the syllabus, but having it integrated into the program can provide more motivation and sometimes more opportunities, especially if your university has local or international partnerships that students can benefit from.

If your career plans are research-focused, check whether your university has good laboratories, collaborations with research institutions, or specialized infrastructure. For example, if you are a biology or chemistry student, you often cannot perform experiments at home and will need access to specialized materials or expensive equipment like microscopes. Make sure to choose a university that can provide these resources.

## Career Prospects After Graduation

Does your university have a strong reputation for preparing students for academic or professional careers in your field? Does it provide access to specialists, organize events to help you find internships, offer support for writing your CV, connect students with industry, provide international exchange opportunities, educational events, additional language courses, or even positions as a teaching or research assistant? Is it open internationally and does it help you build professional and cultural networks?

All of these are important additions to your program that not only enrich your curriculum but also help you gain knowledge and skills beyond what you will acquire just by completing your degree.

# Key Takeaways

In my opinion, these are the most important aspects to consider when choosing a city and university that will be the best fit for you. Of course, this list is not exhaustive, but it highlights the factors you should pay particular attention to.

The goal is to match both the city and the university to your personal needs. The best university is not always in the best city or the most convenient location for you, and the highest-ranked university is not automatically the best choice for your specific program.

University rankings can give you an idea of a school’s reputation and academic quality, but most rankings don’t take all possible factors into account. For example, just because University A scores slightly higher than University B in ranking X doesn’t mean it’s a better fit for your program or for you personally. Choosing Paris “just because it’s Paris” is also not a guarantee of a good experience.

There is no perfect combination of city and university. You might choose a big city and later wish you had more access to nature, or pick a small town and miss the energy and lifestyle of a bigger city. There will always be trade-offs. The point of this guide is to encourage you to do thorough research about your future home, because after all, you’ll probably spend the next 2–3 years or even more there.

Good luck with your [Parcoursup](https://www.parcoursup.gouv.fr/) application! :)
