Classes begin at the start of September, and the first semester ends before Christmas. The week before and the week after Christmas are reserved for exams. Final year exams take place in mid-May. If someone fails, they must retake the exams from the first and/or second semester in June.  

In the middle of each semester, there is a *parciel*, which are exams covering half of the material. This is not the equivalent of a Polish *kolokwium* (which we also have – called *CC* (*contrôle continu*)/QCM/quick), but rather important exams that significantly impact the overall average.  

An example structure of the academic year looks like this:  

**Semester 1:**  
- 6 weeks of classes  
- 1 week break  
- 1 week for *parciel*  
- 6 weeks of classes  
- 1 week for end-of-semester exams  
- 2 weeks break  
- 1 week for end-of-semester exams  

**Semester 2:**  
- 6 weeks of classes  
- 1 week break  
- 1 week for *parciel*  
- 6 weeks of classes  
- 1 week for final year exams  
- 1 week break  
- 1 week for final year exams  

If someone has to retake exams, additional sessions are scheduled in June.
