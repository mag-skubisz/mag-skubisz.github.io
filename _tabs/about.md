Hi, I’m Magda — a CS student from Poland currently studying in France.
My blog is all about my experience studying abroad, how the French education system works, and what everyday life in Grenoble looks like. Overall, it’s a collection of insights and opportunities that come with studying here. I’m sharing all of this because I personally wished I could have found something like this back when I randomly decided one day, to study abroad.

So yeah — I hope it helps someone out there. :)

In the **Archives** section, you can find a full chronological list of my posts.
In **Categories**, you can look for specific topics that interest you. 

If you’re a student from Poland, you can check out the [Campus France Poland Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ambasadorzy_campusfrancepolska/). Along with other ambassadors, I post short, informative updates there about studying and life in France. Here on my blog, you’ll find longer, more organized, and detailed posts on the same topics I write about on Instagram.

You can also explore posts through **tags**.

Have fun reading! And if you have more technical questions about applying to universities in France, you can contact the Campus France office in your country — they’re very helpful when it comes to detailed, administrative topics, and the application process can change slightly every year.

If you have more casual questions about student life in France or in Grenoble, feel free to reach out to me on Instagram.
Enjoy!
