Hi! I’m Magda, a **Computer Science and Applied Mathematics** student currently studying at [**Université Grenoble Alpes**](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/english/home-628540.kjsp) in France.
I’m also a [**Campus France Polska Ambassador**](https://www.pologne.campusfrance.org/pl), [**STAR UGA Ambassador**](https://international.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/internationalisation/dispositifs-d-integration/etudiants-internationaux-a-l-uga-devenez-ambassadeur-star--1065970.kjsp) for the 2025/26 academic year, and a member of the [**IntEGRE**](https://www.instagram.com/association.integre/) organization, where I share my experience, connect with international students, and support those taking their first steps in studying abroad.

On this website, I write about **studying in France**, the French education system, and my personal experience as a Polish student living in Grenoble. My goal is to make my posts international and relatable — to give insights into French student life, culture, and education for anyone thinking about studying or moving abroad.

Beyond academics, I’m passionate about **sports and the outdoors**. After many years of playing handball, I now spend most of my free time hiking and climbing in the Alps around Grenoble.

Another big part of my life is **language learning**. I speak three languages and have always been fascinated by how languages reflect different ways of seeing the world. I love exploring these cultural and linguistic contrasts — they’re a constant reminder of how beautifully diverse our world is.

Through this blog, I also share honest reflections about **living abroad** and finding balance between studying and personal growth. I know how confusing it can feel to move abroad, start university in another language, and wonder if you made the right decision — I’ve been through that.

My mission is to **encourage you to try new things**, even when you’re unsure — because these are the moments that help us grow, open our minds, and build our confidence.

✨ Wherever you are in your journey — whether you’re preparing to study abroad, learning a new language, starting or planning a new adventure, or simply figuring out who you want to become — I hope my blog will inspire you to take that next step with courage and curiosity. ✨
